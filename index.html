            M&amacr;ori culture is a tapestry woven with vibrant traditions, and among
            its featured highlights are the iconic Haka and captivating Kapa Haka performances.
            The Haka, a powerful war dance, transcends its roots and has become a symbol
            of New Zealand's identity, notably performed by the renowned All Blacks
            rugby team. Meanwhile, Kapa Haka showcases the rhythmic fusion of song
            and dance, providing a mesmerizing expression of Māori heritage at cultural
            events and competitions. The intricate art of Whakairo, or carving, is
            evident in the beautifully adorned Wharenui, traditional meeting houses
            adorned with carvings depicting genealogy and history. Marae, sacred communal
            spaces, serve as cultural hubs for social and spiritual activities, hosting
            events like the Pōwhiri welcome ceremony where traditional greetings and
            exchanges occur, including the symbolic hongi.
          <br><br>
          Te Reo Māori, the Māori language, stands as a pillar of Māori culture,
          emphasizing linguistic preservation and cultural identity. Efforts to revitalize
          the language are integrated into education, fostering bilingualism. Tā
          Moko, the traditional Māori tattoo art, tells individual stories through
          intricate designs etched onto the skin. Kaitiakitanga, the principle of
          environmental guardianship, reflects the profound Māori connection to the
          land and the responsibility to protect and sustain it. Celebrating the
          cyclical nature of life, Matariki, the Māori New Year, marks a time of
          reflection and community gatherings under the star cluster Pleiades. Together,
          these cultural highlights illuminate the depth and resilience of Māori
          traditions, showcasing a heritage that continues to thrive and evolve.
